  "readme": "loquire\n=====\n\nloquire lets you require modules using app root relative paths, e.g. ````local('/lib/utils')```` instead of ````require('../../../lib/utils')````. The latter is ugly, hard to maintain, hard to read, and will break when you try to re-organise your app's directory structure.\n\n## Installation\n\t$ npm install loquire\n## Usage\n\nAdd the following at or near the top of your Node app's entry point  (e.g. app.js)\n\n````javascript\nglobal.local = require('loquire')({ rootDir: __dirname });\n````\nThis assumes your app.js entry point is in your apps root directory, otherwise you'll have to set the ````rootDir```` parameter accordingly.\n\nTo use in modules:\n\n````javascript\n// var utils = require('../../../lib/utils');\nvar utils = local('/lib/utils');\n````\n\nApp root relative paths should always start with a forward slash (/lib/utils). If you want to omit the slash to access a module in the same directory, then just use Node's native require function:\n\n````javascript\nvar utils = require('./utils');\n````\n\n## Run Tests\n    $ npm test\n\n## License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Dominic Pettifer &lt;sironfoot@gmail.com&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n",
